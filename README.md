# LeetCode Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in Python, SQL, pandas, and PySpark. The goal of this repository is to document my approaches and provide a reference for others studying for technical interviews or improving their coding skills.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language for algorithmic solutions.
- **SQL**: Used for database-related problems.
- **pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis tasks.
- **PySpark**: Employed for handling big data processing tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project is developed using Python 3.8. Other prerequisites include:
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment manager (optional, but recommended)

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment, navigate to the project's root directory and run:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:

- **On Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
- **On macOS and Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
### Installing Dependencies
Install all required libraries from the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Running Tests
To run the tests, ensure you are in the project root directory and your virtual environment is activated. Then execute:
```bash
pytest
```
This will run all the tests defined in the tests/ directory and provide a report on the outcomes.
